This repository contains a demonstration of a common error in decentralized applications (dApps): incorrect type handling. The `checkWinner.js` file shows buggy code that assumes the `winner` variable is always a string, leading to an error if `winner` is null or undefined.  The solution, in `checkWinnerSolution.js`, demonstrates the corrected code which includes robust type checking to prevent such errors.  This is crucial in DApps to avoid unexpected behavior and vulnerabilities. This simple example highlights a critical aspect of secure DApp development.
